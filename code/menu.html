            <p>Let's face it, 2020 has not been the easiest of years. Birthdays have been no exception. The parties we could freely throw with abandon, have been 
                forbidden/strongly dis-encouraged. For Littles, this can be hard since their whole definition of a Birthday pretty much is centered around cake, parties, gifts and Friends. 
                Obviously, we had to compromise, so we invited just one close Friend for dinner and then enjoyed the rest of the day as a Family. I hoped by creating this
                little menu (filled with some of her favourite things) it would still help to make the Day feel special....
