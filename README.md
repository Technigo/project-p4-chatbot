# Project Name

This assignment was to build a chatbot which would interact with the user. 

## The problem
I decided to build on my current, on-going project and add a chatbot to help navigate my website. Firstly, I wrote down what I intended to do and then the functions which would need to be invoked. I built the chatbot as a stand-alone page and then planned to incorporate it properly, if time allowed. I used conditionals to present the User with different pages, according to their selected interests.
I found this project extremely challenging (the most difficult one yet), but I think by keeping my chatbot relatively simple, I was able to produce something that worked. Gratifyingly, I was then able to incorporate it into my website and I think all links are fully-functioning. I am actually extremely proud of what I have achieved in a relatively short amount of time.
