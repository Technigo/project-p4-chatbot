# Charlie - The Dog-Bot

This is a first attemt at creating a chat-bot, to practice JavaScript. It is based on a template from Technigo. The chat-bots purpose is to guide the user to what kind of dog breed he/she should have. 

## The problem

I changed the theme of the chat-bot from the template "pizza-ordering-bot", to a "dog-bot", using the same logic but just another subject/theme. Or so I thought. My inexperience led me to create something that turned out to be quite complicated and time consuming for me to finish. This version of "Charlie - The Dog-Bot" is not final. There is the "monster" conditional statements harangue left to build. There are two problems left to solve in the code also:

- "Interaction 6": Passing on the "live" function value so that it shows up correctly in the chat. (It show up as "citySuburd" now and it should show as "City/suburb".
- "Interaction 7": I've missed something in the conditional statements (the few that I've written), so I always get the "else" result, no matter what's submitted in the chat.
