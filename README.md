# Project Name

This was my first javascript project. The aim was to build a chatbot which would suggest a recipe according to the chosen paramenters.

## The problem

For me, Javascript was a completely different level than HTML and CSS. While I understand the basic concepts, I feel like I haven't connected the dots yet for Javascript at all and I definitley need to study and practice more in order to really be able to use it.
For this task I took the Technigo Pizza Bot and followed along and adjusted it to my topics.
Unfortunately after a few questions my bot gets stubborn and refuses to continue how I want it to act. I'll try to fix that!
