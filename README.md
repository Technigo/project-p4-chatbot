# Simple bot for taking restaurant order.

First time I dabble with JavaScript, and this project was mainly focused on DOM manipulation through JS. Was given a starter template, and were to complete a full interaction between a user and the bot.

## The problem

Problem was to make sure the bot presented choices the user could choose between. Either through typing in their name, clicking a button or choosing from a drop-down.

The logic behind it all was the same; get the data, store it and pass on in order to continue the conversation and complete an order.

I took an approach where I tried to keep it simple, but still have a wide range of options. To guide the user through their choices. That is, a serial presentation rather than offer any width.

Most of the planning was done in my head (personality trait), but a scetch of the flow was made for easier reference, to keep track of complexity and development status.

I coded in JavaScript, using VS Code, relying heavily on Technigo course material, W3C & Mozilla references, and of course StackOverflow among various searches.

A Live server was set up in VS Code to have easy access to the build in a web browser, as well as DevTools.

If I had more time I would try to add specific prices for each meal, and just another step where the user may choose what to drink. Possibly a summary at the end of all the choices.
